<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="background-and-motivation">Background and Motivation</h2>
<p>.NET collections are linear collections. While there are various types such as hash sets, arrays, lists, and dictionaries, they fundamentally have a linear structure.<br>
On the other hand, general file systems can be considered tree collections. Elements are managed as nodes, forming a hierarchical structure.<br>
While there are existing libraries that support such tree collections, I couldn’t find one that models a file system.<br>
So, I conceptualized and developed a <strong>tree collection that can be treated as pure objects by logically interpreting the file system</strong>.<br>
The aim is to create a system that allows flexible management of hierarchical data and intuitive access.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h2>
<p><code>VirtualStorageLibrary</code> can be utilized in a variety of use cases, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</li>
<li>Knowledge-based systems</li>
<li>Game development</li>
<li>Hierarchical clustering</li>
<li>Education and learning</li>
</ul>
<p>For more detailed use cases and specific applications, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/shimodateakira/VirtualStorageLibrary/blob/master/README.md">README</a>.</p>
<h2 id="design-philosophy">Design Philosophy</h2>
<p><code>VirtualStorageLibrary</code> is designed to provide a tree structure-based collection that operates in-memory, enabling application developers to efficiently manage data. The design emphasizes an intuitive API with flexibility and extensibility in mind.</p>
<h4 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Support for Node Types</strong><br>
In <code>VirtualStorageLibrary</code>, three node types have been defined according to their roles: items, directories, and symbolic links. By making the node roles somewhat specific and limited, it allows for role-specific implementations. This approach is simpler and more efficient than a method where a single node can have multiple roles.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>VirtualItem&lt;T&gt;</code>: A node representing an item that encapsulates a user-defined type <code>T</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>VirtualDirectory</code>: A node representing a directory.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>VirtualSymbolicLink</code>: A node representing a symbolic link.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Loosely Coupled Nodes</strong><br>
Loosely coupled nodes mean minimizing dependencies between nodes, which enhances the flexibility and efficiency of node management. Generally, tree structures have nodes that maintain references to other nodes, supporting node traversal. In <code>VirtualStorageLibrary</code>, only directories hold references to their children nodes, meaning directories only care about their children. This allows for efficient execution of operations like copying or moving the node tree.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for User-defined Types</strong><br>
The main <code>VirtualStorage</code> class in <code>VirtualStorageLibrary</code> is a generic class that handles user-defined types.<br>
Users can define any class they wish.<br>
This allows for flexible handling of application data.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Deep Cloning</strong><br>
Similar to a general file system, each node in <code>VirtualStorageLibrary</code> has its own instance.<br>
This means that multiple nodes do not reference the same instance.<br>
When a node is copied, a deep clone of the node is performed, creating a new node with the same content as the original.<br>
The user-defined type classes encapsulated within the items can support deep cloning by implementing the <code>IVirtualDeepCloneable</code> interface.</li>
<li><strong>Definition of Path Characters</strong><br>
The path characters defined by default are initially set to follow common file system separators <code>/</code>, dot <code>.</code>, dot-dot <code>..</code>, and root character <code>/</code>.<br>
These are initially set in the <code>VirtualStorageSettings</code> class, and after library initialization, they can be modified in the <code>VirtualStorageState</code> class.</li>
<li><strong>Definition of Prohibited Node Name Characters and Strings</strong><br>
The prohibited node name characters defined by default are dot <code>.</code>, dot-dot <code>..</code>, and the prohibited node name string is separator <code>/</code>.<br>
These are used in the node name validity check when adding nodes to a directory.<br>
These are initially set in the <code>VirtualStorageSettings</code> class, and after library initialization, they can be modified in the <code>VirtualStorageState</code> class.</li>
<li><strong>Definition of Node List Display Conditions</strong><br>
The node list can be retrieved according to pre-set display conditions.<br>
The display conditions consist of the following elements:<br>
The default is no filtering, grouping enabled (ascending), and sorting by node name property (ascending).<br>
These are initially set in the <code>VirtualStorageSettings</code> class, and after library initialization, they can be modified in the <code>VirtualStorageState</code> class.
<ul>
<li>Filtering<br>
You can filter by specifying the node type (directory, item, symbolic link) with OR conditions.</li>
<li>Grouping<br>
You can specify whether to group by node type, and when grouping, you can specify the order of the groups (ascending/descending).</li>
<li>Sorting<br>
You can sort within the group when grouped or the entire list when not grouped, by the specified property. You can specify the order (ascending/descending) at that time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="extensibility">Extensibility</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for Wildcards</strong><br>
Paths can include wildcards.<br>
Paths containing wildcards can be expanded into multiple specific paths by calling the wildcard expansion API.<br>
Each API that operates on nodes can perform node operations by passing the expanded paths.</li>
<li><strong>Definition of Wildcard Matchers</strong><br>
Wildcards are processed by a wildcard matcher class that implements the <code>IVirtualWildcardMatcher</code> interface.<br>
<code>VirtualStorageLibrary</code> provides the following two classes in advance.<br>
The default is <code>PowerShellWildcardMatcher</code>.<br>
These are initially set in the <code>VirtualStorageSettings</code> class, and after library initialization, they can be modified in the <code>VirtualStorageState</code> class.<br>
It is also possible to use a custom wildcard matcher by implementing the <code>IVirtualWildcardMatcher</code> interface.
<ul>
<li><code>DefaultWildcardMatcher</code> class<br>
Wildcards using regular expressions as-is.</li>
<li><code>PowerShellWildcardMatcher</code> class<br>
Wildcards adopted in PowerShell.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
