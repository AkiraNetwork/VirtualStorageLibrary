Commercial License for VirtualStorageLibrary

Thank you for your interest in VirtualStorageLibrary!

Current License

VirtualStorageLibrary is currently distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) v3.0 or later. This license allows you to use, modify, and distribute the library for both open-source and closed-source projects, as long as the conditions of the LGPL are met.

Commercial License Option

We are considering offering a commercial license for VirtualStorageLibrary in the future. A commercial license would provide an alternative to the LGPL and could offer additional benefits, such as:

- No Copyleft Obligations: Use the library in your proprietary software without the need to disclose your source code.
- Priority Support: Receive faster and more comprehensive support directly from the library developers.
- Custom Licensing Terms: Negotiate specific licensing terms tailored to your organization's needs.

If you are interested in using VirtualStorageLibrary under a commercial license or have any specific requirements, please contact us at [shimodateakira@i.softbank.jp].

Why a Commercial License?

Offering a commercial license allows us to fund the continued development and maintenance of VirtualStorageLibrary while providing users with more flexibility in how they can use the library.

Future Updates

Please note that we may update the terms of this commercial license offer as our project evolves. Keep an eye on this document for any changes or reach out to us for the most up-to-date information.

Thank you for supporting VirtualStorageLibrary!
